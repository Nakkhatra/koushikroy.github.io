Greetings esteemed reader. You can call me Ifty. A bit about me. I like solving problems and finding patterns. I also love learning new things which lie in the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence.

### Accomplishments
* (20th November 2020) [Paper](http://www.dicta2020.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/51_CameraReady.pdf) published at [Dicta-2020](http://www.dicta2020.org/)

### Experience
* (August - Present, 2021) Machine Learning Engineer at [Nybsys](https://nybsys.com/)
* (August - December, 2020) Machine Learning Researcher at Apurba-NSU Lab([Apurba Technologies](http://www.apurbatech.com/))

### Academic Background
* Undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/)

### Research Interests & Experience
My research interests revolve around everything machine learning with a focus on deep learning. I have done projects and
have a keen interest in problems involving resource-constrained machine learning, optical character recognition, object detection and tracking,
zero-shot image tagging, navigational path planning and swarm robotics.

I have done some research focused on zero-shot tagging with [Dr. Shafin Rahman](https://sites.google.com/site/rshafin/home).
Previously I have also worked with [Dr. Nabeel Mohammad](http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/dr-nabeel-mohammed/) on convolutional capsule networks and optical character recognition and [Dr. Shahnewaz Siddique](http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/dr-shahnewaz-siddique/) on GPS denied navigational path planning for multiple robots.
