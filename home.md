### About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Koushik, currently working full time as a Data Scientist at Nybbles Systems Ltd. tasked with data analysis, visualization, dashboard presentation, and deployment as well as research, development, and deployment of data science, deep learning, and computer vision projects. I helped develop projects such as emergency call management dashboard, mixed fidelity data generation, human fall detection by smartphone sensor data, driver's drowsiness detection with eye aspect ratio, masked face detection, and recognition, etc. Previously, I worked as a Deep Learning Researcher in the Visual Information Processing(VIP) Lab at MIST working on Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction research projects. I did my undergrad thesis work on demand forecasting using time series modeling. I have three published research papers and currently several more under review.

Finally, as a researcher, my goal is to continue my quest for knowledge, study, and share what I learn in order to make a beneficial impact on society.


My industrial intrests revolve around creating products that provide practical solutions through the use of both algorithms and software design. I have experience working with image, text, sensor and tabular data. I also have experience working on the whole data pipeline from data collection upto optimized model deployment.
